# Power BI Project: blinkit Sales Analysis

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. I’ll walk through the key steps and insights generated from the dashboard.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Requirement Gathering/Analysis

  **Total Sales**: Overall revenue from all items sold.
  
  **Number of Items**: Total count of different items sold.
  
  **Average Sale**: Average revenue per sale.
  
  **Average Rating**: Average customer rating for items sold.

### 2. Data Collection

I sourced the relevant data from Kaggle, ensuring I had access to the necessary datasets for analysis and further processing [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomtillo/blinkit-grocery-list-price-city-date)


### 3. Data Source and Transformation

I loaded data from a source (possibly a CSV file) into Power Query.
Applied various transformations to the data, such as filtering, renaming columns, and changing data types.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Shaping

In the “Query Settings” section, I defined a series of applied steps. These steps represent the sequence of operations performed on the data.

Some of the steps include:
    
“Changed Type”: Converting data types (e.g., from text to numeric).

“Filtered Rows”: Selecting specific rows based on conditions.

“Removed Columns”: Eliminating unnecessary columns.

“Replaced Values”: Replacing specific values with others.

“Grouped Data”: Aggregating data based on certain criteria.

### 5. Insights Generation

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 

**Total Sales and Average Unit Sales**


**Insight**: The total sales amount of $1.20M indicates a strong revenue stream. The average unit sale value of $141 suggests that each sale contributes significantly to the overall revenue, highlighting the profitability of individual items.

**Number of Items and Average Rating**


**Insight**: With 9K items sold and an average rating of 3.9, it shows that a wide variety of products are being offered and customers are generally satisfied with their purchases. This high average rating can be leveraged to promote customer trust and loyalty.

#### Total Sales by Fat Content

**Insight**:The donut chart reveals that regular fat products significantly outperform low-fat products in terms of sales, contributing $776.32K compared to $425.36K. This indicates a strong consumer preference for regular fat items, suggesting that marketing efforts and inventory management should prioritize these products to maximize revenue. Additionally, the notable difference in sales could guide product development strategies to enhance the appeal of low-fat products, potentially through improved taste, packaging, or highlighting health benefits.
