# Power BI Project: blinkit Sales Analysis

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. I’ll walk through the key steps and insights generated from the dashboard.

## Steps Involved
### 1. Requirement Gathering/Analysis

  **Total Sales**: Overall revenue from all items sold.
  **Number of Items**: Total count of different items sold.
  **Average Sale**: Average revenue per sale.
  **Average Rating**: Average customer rating for items sold.

### 2. Data Collection
I sourced the relevant data from Kaggle, ensuring I had access to the necessary datasets for analysis and further processing [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomtillo/blinkit-grocery-list-price-city-date)


### 3. Data Source and Transformation

I loaded data from a source (possibly a CSV file) into Power Query.
Applied various transformations to the data, such as filtering, renaming columns, and changing data types.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Shaping

In the “Query Settings” section, I defined a series of applied steps. These steps represent the sequence of operations performed on the data.
    Some of the steps include:
“Changed Type”: Converting data types (e.g., from text to numeric).
“Filtered Rows”: Selecting specific rows based on conditions.
“Removed Columns”: Eliminating unnecessary columns.
“Replaced Values”: Replacing specific values with others.
“Grouped Data”: Aggregating data based on certain criteria.

### 5. Insights Generation
